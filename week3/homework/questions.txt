1. What is a symbol?
    Symbols are identifiers corresponding to strings of characters. Their names are preceded by a colon.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
    Symbols cannot be changed, unlike strings. And a symbol is the same object throughout a program.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
    A block is a chunk of code enclosed between braces or do/end and applied to a method. They are called using the 'yield' statement.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
    A block is passed to a method by placing it immediately after the invocation of the method. A method's signature is its name and its parameters.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
    Regular expressions would be used when matching patterns in strings.
